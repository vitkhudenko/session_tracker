 * During [`SessionTracker.initialize()`][SessionTracker.initialize] and

 * supplier will be used to configure session state machine.
 *
 * A sample (assuming your app has `Session` class, that defines specific to your app events and states
 * (`Session.Event` and `Session.State` enums) could be as this:
 *
 * ```
 *     listOf(
 *         Transition(
 *             event = Session.Event.LOGIN,
 *             statePath = listOf(Session.State.INACTIVE, Session.State.ACTIVE)
 *         ),
 *         Transition(
 *             event = Session.Event.LOGOUT,
 *             statePath = listOf(Session.State.ACTIVE, Session.State.INACTIVE)
 *         ),
 *         Transition(
 *             event = Session.Event.LOGOUT_AND_FORGET,
 *             statePath = listOf(Session.State.ACTIVE, Session.State.FORGOTTEN)
 *         )
 *     )
 * ```
